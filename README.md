# Bet Tribe SEiT Tech Test

Welcome to the Sky Betting and Gaming SEiT tech test.

## Purpose

This tech test aims to assess your technical and testing knowledge and skills in a way which hopefully will require 
a smaller time commitment than a traditional "go and write us some code" tech test, and less stress than a traditional 
"pairing" exercise.

This tech test takes the form of a code review, and reviewing code is a big part of our ways of working at SBG, 
therefore it will also allow you to demonstrate your proficiency in a task that will be a regular part of your 
role if successful.

## The Test

This repository contains the code for a small UI test framework. The framework is using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and their own test runner.
The framework contains UI end-to-end tests.

These test are based upon Flutter's career site using a React front-end framework.
However, the site is fictional (i.e. it does not exist) and as a result these tests cannot actually be run.
This is intentional. We want you to only look at the code, and assess it as you would any test suite.

We would like you to look through this code and review it as you would any other pull request. Please make notes in whatever 
format you are most comfortable with e.g.
* Clone the repository and make comments alongside the code
* Write notes in a note-taking app
* Write notes in a physical notepad

You should also consider:
* Anything you would change or improve
* Anything you feel is missing from the framework

Please ensure you DO NOT do this in a way that would be visible to other potential candidates i.e. forking the code
to add comments or commits, and leaving it public, or creating your own public repo to hold your notes
(make sure any repos are private).

A call should have already been scheduled when this tech test was sent to you. Be prepared to talk through what you 
have noted with one of our existing SEiTs during that call, so we can have a 2-way dialogue about your suggestions and the 
reasons for them.

### What if I don't understand some technologies used in this tech test?

This is fine. Most of the things we are expecting you to identify are not library/language/methodology specific. If you 
really struggle with this though please let our recruitment team know, and we will discuss options.
